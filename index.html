  The colour theory i chose was green, grey and brown
  green represents nature and i feel it relates to the treaty and indegenous
  because the indegenous was all about respecting and appreciating nature.

  grey represents balance and i felt that was to represent the treaty because the treaty was
  created to represent some kind of equality between the indegenous and colonizers.

  brown was the last colour i chose because, brown represents comfort, and 
  seeing as what the indegenous went through and what the treaty represents.
  The treaty acts as kind of a safety for the indegenous and creates security and comfort for them,
  knowing they have at least some type of documents giving them the necessitioes thed esreve and their rights
  on the land stolen from them.
