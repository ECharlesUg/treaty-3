            <li>
              The first Nation to Nation treaty was signed on August 4, 1701.
              The “Great Peace of Montreal” was a peace treaty between New
              France and 40 First Nations of North America. The Great Peace of
              Montreal was made between Louis-Hector de Callière, Governor of
              New France, and 1300 representatives of 40 Aboriginal nations
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>
              Many of the early treaties are described by the First Nations as
              “Peace and Friendship Treaties”
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>
              Between 1760 and 1923, the British Crown signed 56 land treaties
              with Aboriginal Peoples
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>
              As Aboriginal Peoples were strictly an oral tradition they were
              unable to read over the documents they signed; there may also have
              been a language barrier between the Agents of the Crown and the
              First Nation
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>No two treaties are the same</li>
