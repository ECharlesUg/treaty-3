/*
  The colour theory i chose was blue, grey and orange
  blue represents peace and calmness, and i want
  my website to give off a welcoming vibe to users.

  grey represents balance and i felt that was to represent the
  treaty because the treaty wascreated to represent some kind of
  equality between the indegenous and colonizers.

  orange was the last color i chose because it represent fun and playfulness and i want my 
  readers using this website to feel at ease when looking through the different web pages.
