        settlement in their territory. Treaty 3 is 55,000sq. spanning from west
        of thunder bay to north of Sioux lookout, along the international border
        to province of Manitoba- link It is made up of 28 first nation

        aside reserves for the Saulteaux (Ojibwe) and to provide them with
        various monetary awards, including a one-time cash payment of $12 per
        family of five and a yearly payment of $5 per person.
