        Treaty #3 existed in the territory of the Anishinaabe Nation, key to
        Canadian Confederation in that the British wanted to plan a route
        between Fort Garry and Fort William (now Winnipeg, MB and Thunder Bay,
        ON respectively) <b class="reference">(our-nation).</b>

        <br />
        <br />

        The treaty was meant to be the first post-confederation treaty, but the
        Anishinaabe held that they would not cede lands, or allow farming or
        settlement in their territory. Treaty 3 is 55,000sq. spanning from west
        of thunder bay to north of Sioux lookout, along the international border
        to province of Manitoba- link It is made up of 28 first nation
        communities, with a population of approximately 25,000.

        <br />
        <br />

        Under the terms of the treaty, the Government of Canada promised to set
        aside reserves for the Saulteaux (Ojibwe) and to provide them with
        various monetary awards, including a one-time cash payment of $12 per
        family of five and a yearly payment of $5 per person.
